This project applies machine learning algorithms to college admissions.  Proposed schedule for feature implementation:

Milestone #1:
- implement artificial neural network and decision tree algorithms
- include support for training and testing
- process data to be used by the algorithms

Milestone #2:
- implement 2-3 additional ML algorithms (naive bayes,...)
- add approparite data processing options
- ensure that training results can be saved for all algorithms
- write separate files to train and test all algorithms

Milestone #3:
- make adjustments to each algorithm to gauge their highest level of performance
- select one (most promising) algorithm and explore further improvements
- talk to admissions office for ideas on other features that would improve product usefulness (e.g. number of students to accept as a parameter, provide estimated accuracy of prediction)

Milestone #4
- finish improvements to selected algorithm
- implement additional features for admissions office as determined prior to Milestone #3
- build interface to allow use by admissions staff
